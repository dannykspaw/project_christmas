config.py

Step 1: Give script ability to read json config from src folder
Step 2: Specify the location of the src folder
Step 3: Set the global configuration for the overall system to the config found in config json file

Instantiation of env and base config paths are ways to say "Hey, if this doesn't exist as a context (e.g. an environment) or if your config path is not specified, here is a reminder"

Environment variable is global, so this would help switch all workflows across repo given everything can reference your environment variables.

postgres.py:

1: Referencing the config variable in the config.py file that was generated
2: Connecting to DB using the config variables found within Postgres config section
3: Return a cursor that helps execute commands against DB. We return it because this file just spits out your tool to do things with the database.

selenium.py:
1. Creates driver using default options for selenium and condenses driver + options into single variable


redis.py:
1. This would serve as the record for vendor syncs (basically our cache for system metadata)

Best practice to not push configs before going live
